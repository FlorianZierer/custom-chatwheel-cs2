# custom-chatwheel-cs2

I got the idea from this Project{https://github.com/FNScence/CSAFAP-config-package}

Installation: 
1. click on the "<> code" button on github
2. Donload as Zip
3. unpack
4. open
5. got to your CS2 location: Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\
6. drag and drop the downloaded csgo folder into that directory

To create a custom Chatwheel
1. name the slots in csgo/resource/platfrom_english.txt.
2. add commands to slots in csgo/cfg/chatwheels/setup_chatwheels.cfg
3. add Hotkey to open chatwheel (MUST NOT BE SET TROUGH THE SETTINGS MENU)
4. execute setup_chatwheels.cfg in your autoexec or in the console
5. done
